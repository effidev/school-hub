# School-hub : connect everything [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/effidev/school-hub.svg?branch=feature%2Ftravis)](https://travis-ci.org/effidev/school-hub)

## Goals

Currently, school have bad IT. It's time to change! School-hub will be a great and powerful application not only to connect students with their school but also manage school's ressources. Stop spend money on proprietary software. Download the code and create your own web site.

Don't be afraid, it's open source! Even if school-hub does not corresponds to your expectations you're free to fork and suggest any upgrade.
